#**lab 2: build a DC motor**
=========

our second task was to build a functional dc motor from fundamental parts given to us. The motor was to be built upon in the coming practicals.


DC motors are incredibly common as they were the first type of motor that was widely used worldwide. the principle of a working DC motor is *whenever a current
carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a mechanical force*. the direction of this induced force is dictated by *Fleming's left hand rule*:

>F = BIL

they operate by turning electrical energy into mechanical energy. in a typical DC motor, the motor armature, or **rotor**, is suspended between peramanent magnets,
the magnets being stationary, These magnets are called the **stators**. The suspended armature is wired like an electromagnet with coils of wire surrounding the 
armature core. In order for the motor to rotate and function, power is supplied to the armature coils, generatiing a magnetic field throughout the armature.
this in turn will attract and repel against the stators, generating torque. this torque is unidirectional due to the armatures segmented coils.
This will, however, only push the rotor through a turn of 180degrees, as the stator will keep 
the rotor in place at this point because of the static magnetic field. This is why the electromagnet in the armature switches polarity as it rotates. It does this by periodically making contact
with two electrodes, that can be either attached to the armature or remain stationary. these electrodes allow the polarity of the armature to change by reversing the 
direction of current flowing through the coils.

![Diagram of Brushed DC motor](https://www.electrical4u.com/electrical/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dc-motor-parts.jpg)
this diagram shows a brushed DC motor, the same type as we were instructed to build. It, unlike our motor, shows a singled wire armature. 
They can be found in all manner of appliances in all sizes, from small toys to large engines and elevators.


###Construction
--------
to begin with, we wound around **10M** of enameled copper wire around the armature core we were given (a bottle cork) length-ways. this equated to around 100
turns, the ends of the wire were frayed to allow electricity to pass into the wire. these ends of the wire were then attached via soldering to our commutators (copper tape) to create our rotor.
additional measures were taken to ensure the rotors stabililty, such as tape aroubnd the cork.
<image>

then, we construced to motors base to hold the rotor and the stators. To do this, we were given thick metal paperclips and a small plank of wood. after bending the paperclips into position, 
they were secured to the plank using a wide washer and screws. The stator magnets were fixed in position and a "cradle" was construced to suspend the rotor in position whilst still allowing
movement.
<image>

and below is the finished product of the construction, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQmZnGIjSNc&feature=youtu.be "Demonstration Video") is a link to a video
demonstrating its operation.

At this point the next stage of our task was improving the DC motor design. we were given a few avenues to pursue in this notion: 

> Can you build an elegant way of holding the brushed to apply current to the commentator?

> Can you improve the way the armature rotates by using better bearings?

> How would increasing the number of turns of wire affect motor characteristics?

> Consider this in terms of speed, torque and current consumption


to begin with, we rearranged the armature. To improve on it, we gave the armature a second coil. Doing this would help the motor increase it's resolution and
help with the commutation process, also increasing the resolution. both of these coils were wound 100 times and followed the steps taken previously. the copper plate commutators were redone as there 
were now 4 of them. They, like last time, were made sure to be as smooth as possible and cover as much of the circumfrence of the rotor as possible without touching.


#**Lab 3: Incremental Encoder**
===============

the task given to us was to build and attach an incremental encoder to our pre-built DC motor, 
it was to be programmed and managed by an arduino program. incentive was given to improve the resolution of the encoder and to understand its operation.



![Incremental encoder operation](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/2/22/Encoder_diagram.png)
An incremental encoder is a device used to measure the rotational speed of a disc, there are many methods to achieve this end.
 the method of operation is a disc is attatched to a motor shaft. The disc aides with calculating the rotational speed. 
In some cases, a hall effect sensor is used to detect magnets located on the disc, from which the speed, 
direction and location of the motor shaft can be determined. In other cases, an infrared LED and infrared receiver are positioned on either side of the rotational disc, 
except in this case, the rotational disc has some sort of opening, or hole, cut into it. This means the infrared beam will be interrupted until it passes through the hole in the circle, 
making a connection with a pulse. From this pulse the speed of the motor can be determined. If a second LED transmitter and receiver are added to the motor shaft, 
the relative pulses from both receivers can be used to determine the direction of the motor as well as the speed. 
Incremental encoders with the above operations are normally used in permanent magnet brushless motors, to track the rotors position,
 as well as in computer numerical control (CNC) systems and industrial equipment.



For this lab session, we were given the task of building a incremental encoder with an LED transmitter and receiver as its method of operation. 
the disc would be attached to the DC motor we built in the previous laboratory session, and then an industrial motor to compare functionality.

<Circuit Diagram>
Above is the circuit diagram for the infrared transmitter and receiver for the encoder, 
we used the schematic to help us build the circuit. not much trouble was encountered building the circuit, 
but some re-wiring was necessary. in the end, the circuit was fully functional and we were ready to move on to the next stage of the building process, 
attaching the encoder disc.



The rotational disc was made of a thin sheet of cardboard, fashioned into a circle. A small arc was cut into the circle, not deep enough
to reach the centre of the disc though, as this might reduce the structual integrity of the disc as it rotates quickly. 
There was little trouble arranging the disc on the end of the motor shaft.

with the encoder fully assembled, we tested its functionailty. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1t7ziU7dFo "Demonstration") is a link to the demonstration of
the encoder, with a few seconds showing the oscilloscope readings too. 

In the video, you can see some noise on the rising and falling edges of the square wave, we believe this is due to the size of the arc cut out and the method of its cutting,
using scissors may not have given the cleanest cut on cardboard of the discs thickness. The noise may also be due to the the Transmitter and receivers' proximity to the circuit board.
 In addition to that, we found that the speed of the motor had no effect on the width of the square wave, it simply increased or decreased in frequency with speed. 
Changing the size of the cut would change the width of the square wave, proportional to the amount of the disc missing.

below is the arduino code that was modified from the sample code. It was modified to calculate angular velocity by calculating the number of pulses per cycle.

>const byte ledPin = 13;
>
>const byte interruptPin = 2;
>
>volatile byte state = LOW;
>
>volatile int PCount;
>
>void PCounter(){
>
> Pcount++; }
>
>void setup() {
> Serial.begin(9600);
> pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
> pinMode(interruptPin, INPUT);
> // configure the interrupt call-back: blink is called everytime the pin
> // goes from low to high.
> attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(interruptPin), blink, RISING); }
>
>void loop() {
> Pcount = 0; //reset to 0
> delay(20);
> digitalWrite(ledPin, state);
> int result = Pcount; //holds value
> Serial.print(F("Pulse Count = "));
> Serial.println(result); //output to serial }
>
>void blink() {
>state = !state; }

In conclusion, improvements could be made to this system. To begin, a rig could be made for the motor to improve stability,
as well as a cleaner square wave. I would also make changes to the Transmitter/ Reciever circuit to improve its performance.
I would create more distance between the circuit and its effectors, to reduce noise from the circuit. In addition, changing
the design of the cardboard circle could produce more valid data. By dividing the discs circumfrence into 4 equal arcs, 
an easier to read square wave would be produced. this one would would have two pulses equidistant in a complete revolution,
as opposed to a single pulse during the revolution. 


#**Lab 4: Controlling The Motor**
=============

The fourth lab task was to use our DC motor in conjunction with arduino code to better control the motor. Arduino is an 
Open-source hard/ software company and user community that specializes in single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits.

The first part of the task was to simply power a motor using the arduino interface. We used pins 3, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13 and switched them 
all high sending a constant flow of electricity through the pins, thereby powering the motor. Pins 12 and 13 in this case can be set
to either HIGH or LOW, as they determine motor direction and do not power the motor, with HIGH indicating forwards, and LOW backwards.
pins 3 and 11 were also used for a function other than powering motors, they are used to detemrine the speed of the motor via 
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), in this instance they were set to the maximum value of 255.

PWM is a process by which a variable amount of power can be supplied to a component by altering the duty cylce of said component, represented by a percentage.
A common example of PWM at work is dimming LEDs, where the duty cycle percentage applied to them is showcased to the user via their brightness, with a smaller
duty cylce resulting in a dimmer LED. The duty cycle can be further explained by comaparing timelines of different duty cylces.

![comparison of Duty Cycles](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/f/9/c/8/a/512e869bce395fbc64000002.JPG)
In the image above, we can see how the percentage of the cuty cylce indicates the amount of time the component will have power over a time period.
This is an effective way to alter performance of components that have a minimum voltage to operate.

the motors on the arduino board operate through an H-bridge, a circuit that allows the choosing of the motor direction via code.
![H-Bridge Circuit](https://electrosome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Basic-H-Bridge-Circuit.jpg)

Above is a simple H-bridge circuit, as we can see, the motor will only run correctly when S1 and S4 are turned on, or when S2 and S3 are.
Any other combination will cause the motor to fault. But by using these pairs of switches, we as the user can decide the direction of the motor by
choosing from which direction current flows into the motor.

Below is the code we used in order to make the motor follow some basic operations

>int delaylength = 20;
>int speed = 255;
>void setup() {
>pinMode(12, OUTPUT); //HIGH = forwards and LOW = backwards
>pinMode(13, OUTPUT); //HIGH = forwards and LOW = backwards
>pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
>pinMode(8, OUTPUT);}
>
>void loop() {
>digitalWrite(9, LOW);
>digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
>digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
>analogWrite(3, speed);
>delay(delaylength);
>
>digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
>digitalWrite(8, LOW);
>digitalWrite(13, LOW);
>analogWrite(11, speed);
>delay(delaylength);
>
>digitalWrite(9, LOW);
>digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
>digitalWrite(12, LOW);
>analogWrite(3, speed);
>delay(delaylength);
>
>digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
>digitalWrite(8, LOW);
>digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
>analogWrite(11, speed);
>delay(delaylength);}

demonstration of said motor.

#**Lab 6: Stepper Motors**
===================

Stepper Motors are DC motors that move in discrete steps. Like DC motors, they have numerous pairs of coils, 
these are instead called *phases*. The core armature of stepper motors is a permanent magnet. 


![Stepper motor Operation](https://www.pc-control.co.uk/images/step-motor1.gif)
In this case the stepper motor has 4 coils surrounding it.
The operation works as follows:
-all coils start with no power, leaving the rotor in an idle position.
-the first coil in the intended direction is supplied with power, whilst leaving the others powerless.
-after a designated time, the second coil is supplied with power and the first coil has its power removed.
-this process repeats with the incrementing coils being turned on and the previous coild turned off.
This operation is known as full stepping, because 1 phase is used at a time.

there are 3 other methods of controlling stepper motors half-stepping, micro-stepping and double-stepping.


half-stepping: double the resolution of operation by turning on two electromagnets at a time. In a 4 coil stepper motor the 
order of electromagnets with power would go 1, 12, 2, 23, 3, 31, 1
![Half-stepping](http://www.imagesco.com/images/picstepper/fig02.gif)

Micro-stepping: utilise a sin or cosine wave or incremental increases in the coils sequentially in order to increase the 
resolution of the stepper motor revolution to significantly higher levels.
![Micro-Stepping](https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/microstepping_exlained-031.png)
above we can see Coil A recieve incrementally less power, proportional to the power Coil B recieves.

Double-Stepping: similar to half-stepping in that two coils are powered at once, but misses the intermediary step when a 
single coil is powered.
![Comapring Full step with Double step](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/rel-assets/ds-assets/uploads/images/559b8af46dec4ce5b7d823a50ab544b9Picture1.jpg)

This initial code was deemed by us too messy to be the final version, thus we created a variable called "check",
where A/B HL stand for the poles of the motor (A or B) going High or Low.

in conclusion, stepper motors are a versatile tool for mechanical movement via electromagnetism with their low cost and high 
Torque at low speeds and varying resoliton make them useful for a various number of fields, such as pumps and valves.
